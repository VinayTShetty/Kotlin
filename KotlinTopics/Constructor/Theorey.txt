Kotlin constructor

A constructor is a special member function that is invoked when an object of the class is created primarily to initialize variables or properties
A class needs to have a constructor and if we do not declare a constructor, then the compiler generates a default constructor.

Kotlin has two types of constructors –

Primary Constructor
Secondary Constructor
