Extension Function

Kotlin extension function provides a facility to "add" methods to class without inheriting a class or using any type of design pattern. 

Syntax for the Extension function
*********************************

fun <class_name>.<method_name>()  


Example of Student class.
where only Absent and Present method was avaliable.
But Leave method was not avaliable so added the leave method as extension function.


fun main() {
    var studentAttendance_1: String = "A"
    var studentStatus_1: Student = Student();
    println("Student 1 ${studentStatus_1.present(studentAttendance_1)}")

    var studentAttendance_2: String = "L"
    var studentStatus_2: Student = Student();
    println("Student 2 ${studentStatus_2.isOnLeave(studentAttendance_2)}")
}

fun Student.isOnLeave(attendance: String): String {
    if (attendance == "L")
        return "LEAVE"
    else return "INVALID DATA"
}

class Student {
    fun present(attendance: String): String {
        if (attendance == "P")
            return "PRESENT"
        else if (attendance == "A")
            return "ABSENT"
        else return "INVALID DATA"
    }
}
